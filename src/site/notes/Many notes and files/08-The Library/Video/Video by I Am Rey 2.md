Title of the video: Those who watch this will rule the world.

This video describes transcendence, spirituality and breaking world views perfectly. 

One thing I've come to learn is that my idea of focusing on doing the best of both worlds in spirituality and physical world knowledge is the way to progress. I am not going fully for spirituality because I know it is very easy to also get stuck in the same loop of only believing and eventually not being able to see between worlds. 

This video also contains a clear view of how God is mostly presented and thought off in spirituality. Like god being the self and everything else.

I started thinking about why I don't fully revolve my main world view around god yet in another note because of this: [[Many notes and files/06-Personal Hub/Do I believe in god\|Do I believe in god]]
