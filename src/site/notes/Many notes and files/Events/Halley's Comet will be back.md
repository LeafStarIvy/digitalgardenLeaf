## 🎯 Why I'm Looking Forward to This

I am already very interested in space and cosmic events. I heard sometime ago that [[Super Mario Galaxy\|Super Mario Galaxy]] is partly inspired by the Halley's comet. 
This game is dear to my heart and when I heard this it made me very excited about when it would happen. I searched it on the internet and I saw that I could see it in my lifetime. So I immediately put it in my calendar on my phone as a very distant event I will be looking forward too in my life.
