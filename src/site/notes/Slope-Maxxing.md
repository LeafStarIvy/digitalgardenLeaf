# To Slope-Maxx


## R. U. T.
 
### Recognize the slip
. Notice the early warning signs before they turn into habits

#### Note down each time you avoid doing something uncomfortable.

#### Circle of influence. 
Note down what is contributing to you falling down. 
### Use your anchors
. Do the smallest version of the right thing to stop the slip
You need to resetabalize after this.

You cannot think your way back up. You can only move your way back up.

You don't climb because you feel ready, you feel ready because you climb. 

CORE: When you do something or know clearly what needs to happen. And you are able to do it. This is what you need to strive for. 

!!Action will reset emotion quicker than thinking ever will. !!

#### Create a 3 Step good day recipe
If you have a blueprint for a day. You stand a much better chance of stacking good days after another. 

Task:: Buy oat milk ||Test ||This also
Task:: Buy oat mil

IF you do these things I am pretty sure I will feel good after it.

#### If-Then-Plan

Example: IF I feel my energy dip, then I'll take a 30min nap. 
Example: If I start scrolling then I'll switch to long form podcasts. 

### Time your stops
. Rest before empty to maintain your rhythm
The law of momentum: Stop before empty to keep moving forward. 

Set Maxiums



Quote Ernest Hemingway: Stop when it's going good. 
Because when you stop when you have energy, you will wanna do it tomorrow. 
And when you stop when you depleted your energy, you will keep that going for the next time. 

## The law of recovery

Don't measure your progress by how high you climb, measure your progress by how quickly you catch yourself when you slip.
