For 10x more energy close your open loops.

Unfinished tasks no matter how small drain mental energy. 

Open loops need energy to survive, but the upside: Closing them, releases energy. 

We remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones. 

Close the loop -> Reclaim the energy

Always try to keep a grasp on what is the next step. As long as you have that, you will be okay.
