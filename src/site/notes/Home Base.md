# Welcome to My Digital Garden
This is my digital garden that will grow with me with the things I want to do in my life. I am using this to store concepts, thoughts, ideas, memories, tools and all kinds of other things I use and want to keep. It could expand to things I want to present with projects when I come to them. It grows with how my brain works and what I use it for and I will try to make it more presentable trough time. 

### A story about me:
I have always had the struggle that I wanted to do more in my life and needed to surpass different boundaries that I have in my life because of myself and from others. The world is far more complex and different than any of us realize or dare to imagine it be. You never really know how the other person experiences the world and how they think and feel because of it. You can of course create some kind of close world view/perspective when you know them well, but it still isn't close to how they experience it. You don't have the same neural connections and development as they had. In summary: The world of other people is alien. 

So while everything is going on in the world I wanted to begin a checkpoint for my life that I will work out my values and knowledge on. 
This is called a [[digital garden\|digital garden]].

Studying brain
Studying Thinking patterns
Sometimes understanding new perspectives
Studying influences of feeling

Sometimes studying from people and learning from them

Sometimes learning about a subject like Switches and Firewalls/Fortigates

Sometimes learning to pick up a new hobby. But sometimes a hobby or something I want to pick up could also be for a purpose of upping my skills and abilities in a broad way. 

1. I am thinking about maybe having a section that is important to: People, brains, Neural networks, efficiency, perspectives, feelings, Psychology.

Could this one fit the gap of health and exercise? 

2. Another note for physical things like: Firewalls/Switches, Cars, House things, buildings, computers, technologies, 

3. Projects is something separate and that is fine. 

4. Bucket list of what I want to do or try in my life. Maybe add things to it with tags? 
: CPR, 
Quora: So, to the main point: I was saved by friends who knew CPR. Go take a CPR class. Seriously, GO TAKE A CPR CLASS. You don't want to be fumbling around like an idiot if you face a situation like this.

Maybe I should have notes that capture ideas I want to work out or start on. Something like: seeds I come across online and I keep in the pocket that is Obsidian to plant whenever I come too it.
