## Notes/Other Information

HOME (Randy Goffe) is widely regarded as a pioneer of “chillsynth,” blending ’70s/’80s nostalgia with modern chiptune textures. His breakout track “Resonance” remains one of the genre’s most recognizable anthems, inspiring millions of remixes and user-generated edits. While his early output (2013–2017) was prolific, HOME has since released music more sparingly—culminating in the 2019 Hold EP—and maintains a devoted fanbase that preserves and shares his extensive demo archives.
