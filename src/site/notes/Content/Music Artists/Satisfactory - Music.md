## Notes/Other Information


A pioneering force in video game music, Jannik Reuterberg—known as Dream Thing and formerly Sleeper’s Delight—has crafted the immersive, synth-driven ambient soundtrack for Coffee Stain Studios’ Satisfactory. With a career spanning from early sound design work in 2010 to composing major game scores since 2016, his signature style blends lush electronic textures and cinematic motifs. The official Satisfactory Original Soundtrack, released March 28, 2024, features 46 tracks across two discs and is available on Steam, Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube. Key highlights include fan favorites like “Ficsit Inc.,” “Pygmalion Effect,” and “Nostalgium,” alongside the iconic trailer themes from 2019.

Dream Thing’s compositions for Satisfactory blend expansive ambient soundscapes with rhythmic electronic pulses, evoking the otherworldly environments and methodical gameplay of factory building games. Drawing on his background in sound design and earlier game credits (e.g., SteamWorld Heist, 2016), Reuterberg has created a cohesive musical journey that both soothes exploration and heightens the efficiency-driven loop of factory automation. His influences span cinematic electronic artists and synthwave pioneers, resulting in a soundtrack celebrated by both players and critics alike. The OST’s success led to vinyl pre-orders (April 30, 2025 release) and continued community engagement across streaming platforms.
