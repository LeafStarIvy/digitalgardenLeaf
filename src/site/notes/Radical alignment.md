Radical alignment with yourself isÂ ==a holistic state of deep inner harmony and consistency, where your actions, thoughts, and behaviors are in sync with your deepest values, authentic self, and innate worthiness==. It involves unconditionally accepting your true self, including your "good, bad, and ugly" aspects, and acting with integrity to honor your desires and soul's calling, rather than succumbing to societal pressures.
