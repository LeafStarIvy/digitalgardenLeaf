## ðŸŽ¯ YOUR EXAM STRATEGY

### Opening 5 Minutes:

1. Read the scenario carefully - what type is it?

- **Technical vulnerabilities:** 45 min find + fix
- **Security incidents:** 1 hour investigation + response
- **Documentation:** Always reserve 30 minutes minimum
- **Testing:** 15 minutes to verify everything works

### If You're Stuck:

1. Go back to basics - check the Golden 8 first
2. Look at Event Viewer - it shows most problems
3. Ask yourself: "What would cause this symptom?"
4. Google the specific error/symptom you see
5. Don't panic - document what you tried

### Documentation Priority:

1. **What was wrong** (clear description)

**You will encounter:** 1-3 scenarios from Tier 1 (guaranteed), probably 1 from Tier 2, maybe 1 from Tier 3 or 4.

**You won't encounter:** Advanced persistent threats, nation-state attacks, or anything requiring specialized security tools.

**The exam is testing:** Your ability to think systematically, follow procedures, and communicate clearly.

**Remember:** Real IT professionals Google solutions every day. The key is knowing WHAT to look for and HOW to think about problems.

**You've got this!** These scenarios cover literally everything they could throw at you. Follow the checklists, trust the process, and document everything.
